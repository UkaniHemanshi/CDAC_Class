Aryan’s Struggle with Digital Addiction
Aryan, a bright 20-year-old student, started experiencing mood swings whenever he wasn’t on his phone. He’d get irritated and restless, constantly drawn to social media and gaming. Over time, Aryan’s excessive screen time increased; he would lose hours scrolling through apps, often staying up late into the night. His studies began to suffer as he neglected responsibilities, missing deadlines and falling behind in class.

Aryan’s sleep patterns became disrupted, as he couldn’t put his phone down before bed. He constantly felt the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), needing to stay updated on everything online. His productivity dropped, and even though he tried setting screen time limits, he’d frequently ignore them, unable to control his usage.



------------------------------------------strategies for implementing digital detox----------
1. Reducing Screen time

[[


1. Set Clear Goals
Define Time Limits: Set a specific goal for reducing screen time. For example, aim to reduce daily phone usage by an hour or limit social media to 30 minutes per day.
Create Screen-Free Zones: Designate certain areas in your home (e.g., bedroom, dining area) where screens are not allowed, helping to break the habit of constant checking.
Screen-Free Mornings/Evenings: Begin your day without screens for the first 30-60 minutes and avoid them for at least an hour before bed to improve sleep quality.

2. Take Regular Breaks
Pomodoro Technique: Work in intervals (e.g., 25 minutes of focus, followed by a 5-minute break) to avoid long periods of screen exposure.
20-20-20 Rule: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away to reduce eye strain.
Day Without Devices: Plan a full day each week where you disconnect from your devices, allowing yourself a complete digital detox.

3. Schedule Device-Free Activities
Engage in Hobbies: Set aside time for non-screen activities such as reading, exercising, cooking, or pursuing hobbies like painting or writing.
Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices like meditation or yoga that help to center your focus away from digital distractions.
Socialize In Person: Make plans with friends or family that don’t involve screens, such as going for a walk, having a meal together, or doing a group activity.

4. 10. Prioritize Sleep and Well-being
No-Screens Before Bed: Ensure that you stop using screens at least an hour before bed. Blue light from screens can interfere with melatonin production and disrupt your sleep cycle.
Invest in Sleep Hygiene: Create a bedtime routine that doesn't involve screens, such as reading a book or practicing relaxation techniques.
